# Spark-Concepts

## Description
This project is a full stack project that uses node.js, express.js, mysql, sequelize, and handlebars to build up the project.  The project itself is in the same directory as this README.md file for download and use, while a live version is deployed at ([https://spark-concepts-dad483b0ca89.herokuapp.com](#https://spark-concepts-dad483b0ca89.herokuapp.com/)). If the link doesn't work or you wish to use the site in a local server, you can clone the project and deploy it or use it locally.  The purpose of the application is to create an online community for builders or other people who like to create things.  As used in the application a "Spark" is an idea for a project that can be built or an idea of something a user wants to build.  These ideas can be posted on the site and other users can comment and/or provide adivice on how to proceed with developing or building the project.  Of course, the application was created by software developers, but the projects don't necessarily need to lean in that direction, but the belief behind the idea was to create a community where people who make things can communicate on bringing those ideas into reality.

## Questions/Comments
We would like to have a cleaner UI as well as better utilizations for chat gpt which will allow for cleaner inputs and more variable inputs from the user.

Also we have a hard coded category list as well as a goal to utilize metrics for comments/favorites but was not able to fully impletement them in the code base.
