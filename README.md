# Spark-Concepts

## Description
This project is a full stack project that uses node.js, express.js, mysql, sequelize, and handlebars to build up the project.  The project itself is in the same directory as this README.md file for download and use, while a live version is deployed at ([https://spark-concepts-dad483b0ca89.herokuapp.com](#https://spark-concepts-dad483b0ca89.herokuapp.com/)). If the link doesn't work and you wish to use the site in a local server, you can clone the project and deploy it or use it locally.  The purpose of the application is to create an online community for builders or other people who like to create things.  As used in the application a "spark" is an idea for a project that can be built or an idea of something a user wants to build.  These ideas can be posted on the site and other users can comment, and/or provide adivice on how to proceed with the developing or building the project.  Of course, the application was created by software developers, but the projects are no

## Installation
The user needs to have Node.js installed and the dependencies js and inquirer installed in  Node.js

## Usage
When the installation requirements are met, one merely needs to type "node index.js" to start to app and answer the questions.  The required logo will then be build in the "examples" folder (assuming the entire repository is cloned).  One example that is there now is [Square.svg](./examples/square.svg). Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UA608TGSa_yhb_lI-vAUENx-lsB8rIGZ/view?usp=share_link) demonstrating how to use it and how it works.

## Tests
To test the classes that build the shapes one can run the [shapes.test.js](./lib/Shapes/shapes.test.js) in the  ./lib/Shapes folder. To run the tests use a CLI with Node.js installed and  Jest installed as a dependencie,  simply  type "npm run test".  The Package.json file should have the scripts that are required to make the test work correctly. Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yccwgxjyD4WKYDPSVzmHqg1A4LDn0IcU/view?usp=sharing) showing it passing the tests.
